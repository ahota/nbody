# 3D N-body simulation with CUDA and ThreeJS

A parallel implementation of the N-body problem using CUDA with a ThreeJS visualization of the results. 

Documentations
---
The documentations for the 3D N-body simulator and a CUDA matrix multiplier can be found in `docs/nbody-doc/report.pdf` and `docs/matrix-mul-doc/report.pdf` respectively. 

Running example
---
A running sample of the 3D N-body simulation for 512 bodies and 500 timesteps can be found at http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~mahmadza/
